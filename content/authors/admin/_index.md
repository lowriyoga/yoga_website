At a young age Lowri developed an interest for holistic living and spiritual growth. A subscription to the "Mind, Body and Spirit magazine" at 12 years old introduced the path of yoga. Soon after, Lowri attended her first yoga class (back then, in her school gymnasium and dominated by female pensioners) and has been hooked ever since. Although her own asana practice has ebbed and flowed over the years, living her yoga has been a spiritiual practice. In 2020, Lowri finally took the plunge and has been training to become a yoga teacher. Lowri's style of yoga is varied and based on the numerous styles that she has practiced over the years, including: Ashtanga, Vinyasa Flow, Hatha, Forrest, Iyengar, Kundalini and Nidra.
